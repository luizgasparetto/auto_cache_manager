## Instalation 

Getting started with FlutterAutoCache is straightforward and can be accomplished in a few simple steps. You have the flexibility to add it to your project directly from pub.dev or install it locally, depending on your development preferences and workflow.

### Adding via pub.dev
To add FlutterAutoCache to your project, run the following command:

```
flutter pub add flutter_auto_cache
```

### Installing Locally
If you prefer to install FlutterAutoCache locally, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the FlutterAutoCache repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/luizgasparetto/flutter_auto_cache.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to your project's pubspec.yaml file and add the following dependency:
```
dependencies:
  flutter_auto_cache:
    path: ../path_to_flutter_auto_cache
```

#### 3. Install the dependency by running:
```
flutter pub get
```

Once installed, you can start using FlutterAutoCache in your Flutter project to enhance your application's cache management with advanced features, including encryption and efficient disk space management.

## Usage
To use FlutterAutoCache, you need to initialize the cache manager before calling `runApp`. This ensures that all cache configurations are set up correctly. You also have the option to pass your custom initialization configuration.

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  // Optional: Pass a custom CacheConfiguration if needed
  await AutoCacheInitializer.instance.init(configuration: yourCustomConfiguration);

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

After initialization, you can use the cache management methods directly from the AutoCache class. Here is an example of how to access the preferences cache manager:

```
await AutoCache.prefs.getString(key: "my_string_cached");
```

With this setup, you can easily manage your application's cache using the methods provided by AutoCache.

> **Note**
> Each property of the `CacheConfiguration` can have a different impact on how the cache behaves. It is important to understand these prCooperties to optimize your application's performance and reliability.
